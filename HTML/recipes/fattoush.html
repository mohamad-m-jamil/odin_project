    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fattoush is a vibrant and refreshing Lebanese salad that combines fresh vegetables with crispy pieces of fried or toasted pita bread. Traditionally, it serves as a way to utilize leftover bread, making it both resourceful and delicious. The salad typically includes ingredients like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and a variety of herbs such as parsley and mint. It is dressed with a tangy mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, and often flavored with sumac and pomegranate molasses for an extra kick.
