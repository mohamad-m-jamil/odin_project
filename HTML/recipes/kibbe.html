    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Kibbeh Nayeh is a traditional Lebanese dish consisting of raw minced meat, typically lamb or beef, mixed with fine bulgur wheat and spices. It is often served as a delicacy in Middle Eastern cuisine, accompanied by olive oil, fresh herbs, and pita bread. The preparation requires high-quality, fresh meat and careful attention to hygiene due to its raw nature.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>step 1</h2></li>
            <h3>Prepare the Bulgur and Meat</h3>
            <p>Soak fine bulgur wheat in water for about 40 minutes to an hour until softened. Drain it well.
                Use fresh lean lamb or beef, cutting it into chunks. For best results, grind the meat in a food processor until finely minced, or use a traditional mortar and pestle.</p>
        <li><h2>step 2</h2></li>
            <h3>Mix Ingredients:</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground meat with the soaked bulgur, finely chopped onion, and spices such as allspice, white pepper, and Lebanese seven spices. Knead 
                the mixture by hand for about 5-7 minutes until well combined. If needed, wet your hands with cold water to help with the mixing.</p>
        <li><h2>step 3</h2></li>
            <h3>Shape and Serve:</h3>
            <p>Transfer the kibbeh mixture onto a serving plate, flattening it into an even layer. Use a fork to create decorative lines on top. Drizzle with high-quality extra virgin olive oil 
            and garnish with fresh herbs like mint or parsley. Serve immediately with pita bread and accompaniments like radishes or cucumber.            </p>
    </ul>
